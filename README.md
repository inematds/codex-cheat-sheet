### Model Updates (September 2026)

**GPT-6 Astra** is the new flagship model, rolling out across clients:
- Purpose-built for the hardest end-to-end work across code, apps, and research
- Combines advanced reasoning, computer use, and stronger judgment
- Use it when a task needs sustained reasoning across multiple steps and tools

**GPT-5.6 Sol** remains the GPT-5.6 flagship:
- Purpose-built for complex coding, computer use, research, and security work
- Superior instruction following and technical accuracy

**GPT-5.6 Terra** balances capability and cost:
- Optimized for everyday coding and knowledge work
- Strong reasoning with efficient token usage

**GPT-5.6 Luna** is the fastest, lowest-cost option:
- Ideal for lightweight tasks and quick iterations
- Maintains quality while minimizing latency

**Retirements:** gpt-5.4 and gpt-5.4-mini retired from Codex with ChatGPT sign-in on August 31, 2026 (replace with gpt-5.6-terra and gpt-5.6-luna); gpt-5.2 and gpt-5.3-codex are deprecated. The OpenAI API and API-key sign-in are unaffected.

# Create custom prompts in ~/.codex/prompts/

# Example: Create ~/.codex/prompts/review.md
# Then use with:
"Use the review prompt on this code"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Memory with AGENTS.md</strong></summary>

```bash
# Create AGENTS.md in project root
# Codex will remember project-specific context

# Example AGENTS.md content:

"""
```

</details>

## Level 4: Advanced Features

Powerful features for advanced workflows.

<details>
<summary><strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Configure MCP servers in ~/.codex/config.toml

# STDIO server example
[mcp_servers.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
env = { API_KEY = "value" }

# Streamable HTTP server example
[mcp_servers.figma]
url = "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "FIGMA_TOKEN"

# MCP CLI commands
codex mcp list                        # List configured servers
codex mcp add <name> -- <command>     # Add a server
codex mcp get <name>                  # Show server details
codex mcp remove <name>               # Remove a server
codex mcp login <name>                # OAuth login (streamable HTTP)
codex mcp logout <name>               # OAuth logout

# Popular MCP servers:
# - Context7 (developer documentation)
# - Figma (design access)
# - Playwright (browser control)
# - GitHub (GitHub API access)
# - Sentry (log access)
```

See [MCP Documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/configuration) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sandbox & Permissions</strong></summary>

```bash
# Configure sandbox mode in config.toml
sandbox_mode = "read-only"              # Default: read-only
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"        # Allow writes in workspace
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"     # Disable sandbox (dangerous!)

# Configure approval policy (valid: untrusted | on-request | never; "on-failure" is deprecated)
approval_policy = "untrusted"           # Prompt for untrusted commands
approval_policy = "on-request"          # Model decides when to ask (interactive)
approval_policy = "never"               # Never prompt (non-interactive runs)

# Workspace-write options
[sandbox_workspace_write]
writable_roots = ["/path/to/extra/dir"]
network_access = false
exclude_tmpdir_env_var = false
exclude_slash_tmp = false
```

See [Sandbox & Approvals](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sandboxing) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Non-Interactive Mode</strong></summary>

```bash
# Execute and exit with codex exec
codex exec "summarize all TODO comments in this project"

# Auto-review approvals (workspace-write sandbox, automatic review)
codex exec --approve-for-me "refactor this code"

# Fully unattended (dangerous - skips all approvals and sandboxing)
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox "refactor this code"

# Full access (dangerous!)
codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access "your task"

# JSON output for automation
codex exec --json "analyze this project"

# Structured output with JSON schema
codex exec --output-schema schema.json "extract project details"

# Save output to file
codex exec -o output.txt "generate docs"
```

See [Non-Interactive Mode (exec)](https://developers.openai.com/codex/non-interactive-mode) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Piping and Scripting</strong></summary>

```bash
# Pipe content to Codex
cat logs.txt | codex exec "find the error"

# Use in scripts
git diff | codex exec "create a conventional commit message"

# Combine commands
codex exec "explain this file" < app.js > explanation.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Skills</strong></summary>

<a id="skills"></a>

- **What they are:** Native, on-disk reusable capabilities that Codex can auto-discover. Each skill is a bundle with `name`, `description`, and an optional body kept on disk. Skills are generally available — no feature flag required.
- **Where skills live:** `~/.codex/skills/**/SKILL.md` (recursive). Only files named exactly `SKILL.md` count; hidden entries and symlinks are skipped.
- **File format (YAML frontmatter + body):**
  ```markdown
  ---
  name: your-skill-name          # required, ≤ 100 chars, single line
  description: when/why to use   # required, ≤ 500 chars, single line
  ---

  # Optional body (kept on disk)
  Add references, workflows, or examples here.
  ```
- **Using skills:** Mention with `$<skill-name>` in chat or browse/insert via `/skills` in the TUI. Codex injects only `name`, `description`, and the absolute file path.
- **Validation behavior:** Invalid frontmatter triggers a dismissible startup modal and log entries; invalid skills are ignored until fixed.
- **Sample skills in this repo:** Copy or symlink any of the samples below into `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, then restart Codex:
  - `skills/pdf-processing/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/log-review/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/form-filling/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/project-management/SKILL.md`
- **Pair with GitHub Skills:** You can combine Codex skills with the learning paths at [github.com/skills](https://github.com/skills) to onboard teams quickly while keeping reusable Codex guidance locally.
- **Community alternative (pre-native skills):** The [openskills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) project remains a viable open source option if you prefer a community-driven skills system.

## New Features 2025-2026

Recent additions to Codex that you should know about:

<details>
<summary><strong>Task Goals</strong></summary>

The `/goal` command sets a persisted objective for a long-running task. It loops plan → act → test → review until your stop condition is met.

**Usage:**

```bash
/goal Finish the migration and keep tests green    # Set a goal
/goal                                               # View current goal
/goal pause                                         # Pause the current run
/goal resume                                        # Resume a paused run
/goal clear                                         # Clear the current goal
```

**When to use:** Multi-hour validated work with a clear "done" definition.
**Skip it:** If you are still exploring or making judgment calls.

> **Note:** Define one measurable stop condition. Use `/goal pause` or `/goal clear` if it drifts. Run on a scratch branch.

See [OpenAI's follow-a-goal docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>babysit-pr Skill</strong></summary>

The `babysit-pr` skill automates PR maintenance:
- Auto-fixes CI failures
- Handles review comments
- Watches for merge conflicts
- Keeps your PRs moving through the pipeline

```bash
# Use with MCP GitHub integration
codex "babysit this PR with $github"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>JavaScript REPL (js_repl)</strong></summary>

Persistent JavaScript REPL for incremental code execution:
- Test code snippets in real-time
- Iterate on logic without full re-runs
- Debug complex expressions

```bash
# Enable in config.toml
[mcp_servers.js_repl]
command = "node"
args = ["-e", "process.stdin.on('data', d => eval(d.toString()))"]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>In-Process App Server</strong></summary>

New architecture for non-interactive `exec` mode:
- Faster startup times
- Better for CI/CD integration
- Reduced overhead for automation scripts

</details>

## Credits and Inspiration

This cheat sheet was inspired by the excellent [claude-code-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/Njengah/claude-code-cheat-sheet) by @Njengah. We adapted their progressive learning structure to create a similar quick reference guide for OpenAI Codex CLI.

All commands and examples are verified against the [official OpenAI Codex documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex).

**Last updated: July 2026**  
**Based on**: OpenAI Codex CLI (npm: @openai/codex)
